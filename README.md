  Face Recognition
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
 </h2>
In this project, we try to solve the face recognition problem using PCA. Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a powerful tool used to analyze data sets and is formulated in the language of linear algebra and statistics. It is an eigenvalue method used to reduce the dimension of a data set while preserving important information.
This program is trained by training dataset and tested by testing dataset available in the local file.

  How to Run
</h2>
All the code is needed is implemented in “main.m”. The classes are defined in separate files. Efficiently you can run the “main.m” file and get the result.
